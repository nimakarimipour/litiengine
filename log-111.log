Asking ChatGPT:
In the method below, is there a possibility that the expression "return null;" at line "return null;" is null?
public static <T> JAXBContext getContext(Class<T> cls) {
    try {
      final JAXBContext jaxbContext;
      if (jaxbContexts.containsKey(cls)) {
        jaxbContext = jaxbContexts.get(cls);
      } else {
        jaxbContext = JAXBContext.newInstance(cls);
        jaxbContexts.put(cls, jaxbContext);
      }
      return jaxbContext;
    } catch (final JAXBException e) {
      log.log(Level.SEVERE, e.getMessage(), e);
    }

    return null;
}
Give a single-word answer in XML format. If it is possible for the expression to be null, respond with:
```xml
<response>
    <reason><![CDATA[YOUR REASON]]></reason>
    <value>YES</value>
</response>
```
If it is not possible for the expression to be null, respond with:
```xml
<response>
    <reason><![CDATA[YOUR REASON]]></reason>
    <value>NO</value>
</response>
```
If you are unsure or need more information, respond with where you can ask for more details or what specific information you need.

If additional information is required, list each request inside a `<request>` tag. If no additional information is needed, omit the `<requests>` section.

Respond with:
```xml
<response>
    <reason><![CDATA[YOUR REASON]]></reason>
    <value>UNKNOWN</value>
    <!-- Include <requests> only if additional information is needed -->
    <requests>
