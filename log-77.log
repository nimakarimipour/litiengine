Asking ChatGPT:
I want to resolve a warning reported by NullAway.
The error is of the type of "METHOD_NO_INIT" and the full error message is: "initializer method does not guarantee @NonNull fields sound (line 29), playback (line 30) are initialized along all control-flow paths (remember to check for exceptions or early returns).".
The line with the error is: "  public SoundSource(String name) {".

The error is within "the method: SoundSource(java.lang.String)" and the code surrounding the error is:
```java
  public SoundSource() {
    super();
  }

  /**
   * Initialize a SoundSource with a Sound.
   *
   * @param sound The sound used for playback
   */
  public SoundSource(Sound sound) {
    this.setSound(sound);
  }

  /**
   * Initialize a SoundSource with the name of a sound which will then be fetched from the {@code
   * Resources.sounds()}.
   *
   * @param name The name of the sound used for playback
   * @see Sounds#get(String)
   */
  public SoundSource(String name) {
    this.setSound(name);
  }

  /**
   * Initialize a SoundSource at a certain location.
   *
   * @param x The x coordinate
   * @param y The y coordinate
   */
  public SoundSource(double x, double y) {
    this.setX(x);
    this.setY(y);
  }

  /**
   * Initialize a SoundSource at a certain location with a given size. The size is irrelevant for
   * the sound playback.
   *
   * @param x The x coordinate
```

Give me the fixed code snippet (ONLY THE METHOD REWRITE OF "SoundSource(java.lang.String)") in XML format in <response> tag like the example below. I will apply the fix to my codebase.
Do not import any additional libraries or classes or java comments.
If you can provide the fixed code snippet, provide it in the following format and place the code snippet in the <code> tag within ```java block.
