Asking ChatGPT:
I want to resolve a warning reported by NullAway.
The error is of the type of "RETURN_NULLABLE" and the full error message is: "returning @Nullable expression from method with @NonNull return type".
The line with the error is: "      return null;".

The error is within "the method: forName(java.lang.String)" and the code surrounding the error is:
