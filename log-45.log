Asking ChatGPT:
I want to resolve a warning reported by NullAway.
The error is of the type of "RETURN_NULLABLE" and the full error message is: "returning @Nullable expression from method with @NonNull return type".
The line with the error is: "    return this.camera;".

The error is within "the method: camera()" and the code surrounding the error is:
```java
  }

  /**
   * Detaches the specified updatable instance from the updating of environments with the specified
   * map name.
   *
   * @param mapName The name of the map for which to detach the updatable instance.
   * @param updateable The updatable instance to detach.
   */
  public void detach(String mapName, IUpdateable updateable) {
    remove(this.updatables, mapName, updateable);
  }

  /**
   * Gets the game's current {@code Camera}.
   *
   * @return The currently active camera.
   * @see ICamera
   */
  public ICamera camera() {
    return this.camera;
  }

  /**
   * Gets the game's current {@code Environment}.
   *
   * @return The currently active environment.
   * @see Environment
   */
  public Environment environment() {
    return this.environment;
  }

  /**
   * Gets the game worlds gravity that is applied to any environment. This can e.g. be useful for
   * platformers.
   *
   * @return The gravity of the game world that gets applied to any environment.
   */
  public int gravity() {
```

Give me the fixed code snippet (ONLY THE METHOD REWRITE OF "camera()") in XML format in <response> tag like the example below. I will apply the fix to my codebase.
Do not import any additional libraries or classes or java comments.
