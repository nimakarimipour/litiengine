Asking ChatGPT:
I want to resolve a warning reported by NullAway.
The error is of the type of "RETURN_NULLABLE" and the full error message is: "returning @Nullable expression from method with @NonNull return type".
The line with the error is: "    return this.environment;".

The error is within "the method: environment()" and the code surrounding the error is:
```java
    remove(this.updatables, mapName, updateable);
  }

  /**
   * Gets the game's current {@code Camera}.
   *
   * @return The currently active camera.
   * @see ICamera
   */
  public ICamera camera() {
    return this.camera;
  }

  /**
   * Gets the game's current {@code Environment}.
   *
   * @return The currently active environment.
   * @see Environment
   */
  public Environment environment() {
    return this.environment;
  }

  /**
   * Gets the game worlds gravity that is applied to any environment. This can e.g. be useful for
   * platformers.
   *
   * @return The gravity of the game world that gets applied to any environment.
   */
  public int gravity() {
    return this.gravity;
  }

  /**
   * Clears the currently active camera and environment, removes all previously loaded environments
   * and clears all listener lists.
   */
  public void clear() {
    this.unloadEnvironment();
    this.environments.clear();
```

Give me the fixed code snippet (ONLY THE METHOD REWRITE OF "environment()") in XML format in <response> tag like the example below. I will apply the fix to my codebase.
Do not import any additional libraries or classes or java comments.
If you can provide the fixed code snippet, provide it in the following format and place the code snippet in the <code> tag within ```java block.

  <success>true</success>
