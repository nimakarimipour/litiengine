Asking ChatGPT:
In the method below, is there a possibility that the expression "entity.movement()" at line "entity.movement().apply(force);" is null?
private void addGravityForce(IMobileEntity entity) {
    IMovementController mvmtControl = entity.movement();
    if (mvmtControl != null) {
      GravityForce force = new GravityForce(entity, this.getGravity(), Direction.DOWN);
      force.setIdentifier(GRAVITY_IDENTIFIER);
      entity.movement().apply(force);
      this.gravityForces.put(entity.getMapId(), force);
    }
}

Response created:
Disagreement: Since there's a null check for "entity.movement()" before applying "apply(force)", if "entity.movement()" was null, the method would not attempt to apply the force. Therefore, during "entity.movement().apply(force)", "entity.movement()" cannot be null.

False positive detected.
---NullAwayCodeFix.constructCastToNonnullChange---
Constructing cast to nonnull change for reason: Since there's a null check for "entity.movement()" before applying "apply(force)", if "entity.movement()" was null, the method would not attempt to apply the force. Therefore, during "entity.movement().apply(force)", "entity.movement()" cannot be null.
